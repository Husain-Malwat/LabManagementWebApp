# XSS Attack
Implementing XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks typically involves injecting malicious scripts into a web page, which are then performed in the context of other users' browsers. Here are several reasons why our HTML pages are notÂ vulnerable to XSS attacks.  

1. Our inputs are thoroughly sanitized. All of the fields use their appropriate input types, which automatically give some amount of input validation.
2. Our pages do not appear to include user-generated content that attackers could use to run harmful code. Without such content, there are no opportunities for attackers to inject their scripts.
3. Our pages incorporate external libraries, such as Tailwind CSS, from reliable sources. These libraries are less likely to have vulnerabilities that could be used for XSS attacks.
4. Our pages do include client-side scripting.
5. Our pages do not appear to dynamically insert content from untrusted sources into the DOM.
