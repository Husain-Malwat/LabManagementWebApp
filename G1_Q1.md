2. The student interface lacked an inventory option that would allow students to view all available equipment by department.
3. There was no email notification feature for students to confirm successful equipment bookings.

# After feedback 1

1. From the feedback collected from the stakeholders, the major concern among them was about the return date so this was addressed after the feedback 1.

2. An inventory tab was added adjacent to the profile table at the upper right corner. This lets the student get information about all the equipment available
